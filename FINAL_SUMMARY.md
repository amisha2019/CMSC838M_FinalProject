# PI-EquiBot Codebase Fixes - Final Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of all the issues and fixes applied to the PI-EquiBot codebase to enable successful training on the cluster.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DDPMScheduler Device Error
The `DDPMScheduler` from the diffusers library doesn't support the `.to(device)` method, but it was being called in the code. We removed this call and updated the initialization approach.

### 2. Missing Configuration Parameters
Several required configuration parameters were missing, causing crashes during initialization:
- Added `training.weight_decay` (default: 1e-6) for optimizer initialization
- Added proper handling for when `training.ckpt` is missing
- Added `use_curriculum` parameter for training configuration

### 3. Configuration Key Mismatch
Code was trying to access `cfg.train` but the actual key in configuration was `cfg.training`. We updated all instances to use the correct key.

### 4. Normalizer Shape Mismatch
The most complex issue was a shape mismatch in the normalizer class. When normalizing action tensors with different dimensions than the statistics were created for, it would cause tensor broadcasting errors. We implemented a robust fix with proper tensor reshaping.

### 5. System Compatibility
Added proper environment setup with `LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libstdc++.so.6` to ensure library compatibility.

## Testing and Validation

We created several test scripts to verify our fixes:
1. `test_normalizer_fix.py` - Directly tests the fixed normalizer class
2. `test_fixes.sh` - A comprehensive test suite for all components
3. `test_training_job.py` - Attempts to run a minimal training job

## Training Jobs

After applying all fixes, the training jobs were successfully submitted to the cluster using the updated `submit_training_evaluation_fixed_v2.sh` script. This script runs training jobs for all combinations of:
- Tasks: fold, cover, close
- Variants: A, B, C, D, E
- Seeds: 0, 1, 2

The fixes enabled these jobs to run without crashing due to the previously identified issues.

## Environment Setup

To run the codebase, ensure you have the following:
1. Conda environment with Python 3.10+
2. Required packages:
   - pybullet
   - diffusers
   - hydra-core
   - wandb
   - torch
3. Set the library path with: `export LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libstdc++.so.6`

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more robust error handling in the normalizer class to automatically handle different tensor dimensions
2. Add validation of configuration parameters before use to catch missing parameters earlier
3. Create a comprehensive test suite that can be run regularly to catch similar issues before they affect production training jobs

## Conclusion

The fixes have successfully addressed all the issues preventing the PI-EquiBot training from running on the cluster. The code now properly handles tensor shape mismatches, configuration issues, and environment setup, allowing for successful model training.
